## Key Learning Points

This project was a great exercise in:

* Implementing game loops and managing game state.
* Using vector mathematics for movement and collision detection.
* Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to model game objects like the `Ship`, `Asteroid`, and `Shot`.
* Handling user keyboard inputs for real-time interaction.
